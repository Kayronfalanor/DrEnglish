                    <span> Hello everyone </span>and welcome to a new world of learning the English language. We are excited to assist your company and your employees on the journey to fulfilling lifelong and bottom line goals. I came to Korea with a backpack, desire of adventure and a longing to educate people in the English language. Over the past twenty-plus years I can say I have learned as much as I have taught. I have taken all these lessons and compiled them into a cutting-edge method to learn English. After more than 15 years of experience teaching at the corporate level I have created Dr. English, a 1 to 1 real time video learning experience for students of all levels and background. I realized that there is a real need for people to be able to express their ideas and show their skills in English. Sometimes this is needed domesticallybut other times a company may want to expand across its borders. The reality of the necessity of the English language is now more important than ever. Around the world, 1 in 4 people use English in business transactions. Our goalat Dr. English is to give the learners the confidence, ability and knowledge to walk into any situation and excel at selling, producing, manufacturing, and researching any and all products that are needed. I have seen the need to be able to adapt and change in accordance with one’s environment and have implemented those characteristics into our program. We offer fully compatible language programs aimed at each of our client’s unique needs. We have a fully trained staff with years of experience in the Asia-Pacific region that is ready to get the job done. I look forward to sharing this experience with you.
